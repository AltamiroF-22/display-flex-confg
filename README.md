# Important

This project is not completely finished yet.
I'll be making some changes, such as adding alerts when you place more than 20 boxes in the preview area, and including additional links and more in the footer.
Although I developed this project using vanilla JavaScript, I'm unsure whether I will attempt to port it to React.
Is not responsive too.

## what it is this project for?

This project is for people who don't know how to use 'Display-Flex' proprities, for exemple how to center a <div> and more :)
